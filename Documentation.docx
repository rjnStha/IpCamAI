/*/ Problem \*\

Cannot access the ip camera via NVR 


/*/	Blueprint Objective	\*\

1. Access Ip cameras from laptop

    Anaconda => OpenCV
        - conda(Python agnostic) vs pip(Python packages only)

    NVR
        - Network Video Recorder
        - specialized computer that records security video surveillance footage in digital format to a 
            hard drive.

    RTSP
        - Real Time Streaming Protocol
    	- Play audio and video straight from the internet, rather than having to download media files 
        	to their devices.
    	- RTSP port (usually 554)
        - Url => rtsp://admin:12345@192.168.1.210:554/Streaming/Channels/101

    Port Forwarding
        - Router has 2 IP address: LAN and WAN
        - Network Address Translation (NAT) 
    
    Static IP vs Dynamic DNS vs DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
